obj51,Flight Data Visualization of COPA Airlines,Sarthak Sharma,2020,DSLR,Graduate Student,Scientific Computing,Data Science / Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence,"This is an exercise in data visualization. It is important to be able to visualize data, to get important insights that may not be apparent when we look at just numbers. 
 
This visualization uses Machine Learning to predict flight delays in departure and arrival and, if possible, utilizing Artificial Intelligence to automate the flight scheduling process of COPA Airlines (which at present is done manually) to increase efficiency, reduce delays, and improve customer experience.

Data of some random flights of Copa Airlines is visualized as a network, where nodes represent the flights, and links or connections between the nodes represent passenger transfers between flights at PTY airport at Panama City. (PTY airport is the hub of COPA Airlines, so almost all flights of COPA Airlines have PTY airport as either origin or destination.)
 
Nodes (representing flights): All the nodes are in a circular arrangement. Each node is labeled with 6 letters of the flight’s origin-destination code. The first 3 letters denote the flight’s origin airport, and the last 3 letters denote the flight’s destination airport.

*	The node color is red for inbound flights (arriving at PTY airport), and green for outbound flights (departing from PTY airport). 

*	The node size is directly proportional to the flight distance (that is, distance between origin and destination airports). 

*	Links between nodes (representing passenger transfers at PTY airport, from inbound flights to outbound flights): 
*	The link color is directly proportional to the number of passengers transferring (varying from light for few passengers, to dark for many passengers).
*	Thickness is constant for all links.",,,1,qatar_item,art2022,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/obj51/full/250,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/images/obj51/full/full/0/default.jpg,/img/derivatives/iiif/obj51/manifest.json

We use gRNA mediated gene deletion, exploiting CRISPR/Cas9 system to delete specific gene of interest from primary cell line. In this image, a technique called FISH (fluorescence in-situ hybridization) is used to verify that the ATRX gene, located on X chromosome, has been deleted from active X-chromosome in RPE1 cell line. 
ATRX-specific probe(green) can only be seen in one X-chromosome. Chromosomes are stained in DAPI and red probe is showing the ZFX gene, a X-specific gene, used to locate X-chromosome.

obj55,All Paths Lead to the Best Tree,Marzieh Khodaei,2019,DSLR,Graduate Student,Scientific Computing,Computational Science,"Phylogenetic trees are fundamental for understanding the evolutionary history of a set of species. Understanding the local neighborhoods of a phylogenetic tree is essential, but since trees are high-dimensional objects, discussing these neighborhoods is difficult. We developed the Python package Pathtrees that uses the geodesic distance between pairs of trees and their likelihoods to build a continuous tree landscape. The art piece shows an example of trees along the shortest path (geodesic) between three arbitrary trees (colored triangles) in the tree space. We used the cubic spline interpolation and the multidimensional scaling  to display both the contour (left) and the surface (right) of the space of 1,000 trees and 20 pathtrees (red dots). We use this tool to find the best tree and describe its neighborhood.",,,5,qatar_item,art2022,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/obj55/full/250,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/images/obj55/full/full/0/default.jpg,/img/derivatives/iiif/obj55/manifest.json
