obj03,Watched Over By Angels,Bobbie Renfro,2019,DSLR,Graduate Student,Biology,Coral Reef Ecology,My work broadly focuses on the effects of human activities on coral reef ecosystems. More specifically I am interested in how nutrient enrichment from mismanaged waste water and fertilizers affects the sponges that inhabit the coral reef. These grey angelfish (Pomacanthus arcuatus) perused the reef around me as I assessed sponge populations in Belize.

obj04,Bio-cultural Symmetry,Benjamin Stewart,2018,DSLR,Graduate Student,Anthropology,"Zooarchaeology, paleoethnobotany, environment and ecology, and households in archaeology","### Bronfenbrennerâ€™s ecological systems theory and symmetrical archaeology are underlying principles and theoretical framework that looks at the arrangements of symmetrical relationships of human behaviors such as past and present, people and place, individuals and society, biology and culture in various systems. It is a way to view how humans are intrinsically interconnected to everything in our world. In this case, the relationship of my study is how humans are ""drivers"" or ""actors"" in complexities of nature, specifically in ecosystems. The symmetrical relationship between humans and plants, directly and indirectly, shape our environment and our culture. In this example, photographed is a purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) at this angle, in part, to demonstrate two observable phenomena. One is to show the symmetry found in nature as it is artistically photographed here and the other is the symmetrical relationship between humans and plants. E. purpurea was and is widely used by the Plains Indians and Choctaw Native Americans for a painkiller, cough treatment, and gastro-intestinal aid and later used as an immune-stimulant in modern medicine. This symmetrical relationship established that the human need for medicinal treatment which slowly turns into a symbiotic relationship making a connection between humans and plants. The connection then alters the environment indirectly to support both species. Then finally, the cultural aspect of humanity is imbued to the object, in this case, the purple coneflower creating the bio-cultural symmetrical relationship.",,,03,qatar_item,artinSTEM,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/obj04/full/250,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/images/obj04/full/full/0/default.jpg,/img/derivatives/iiif/obj04/manifest.json

obj09,Neuronal Signaling of the Cerebellar-like Organoid Cells,Timothy Hua,2019,Microscope,Graduate Student,Chemistry and Biochemistry,Organoid differentiation and brain cancer research,Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (HiPSCs) can differentiate into any cell types within the human body. They have been used to generate various organoid models that mimic the organs of interest such as the brain for development studying and disease modeling. The cerebellum (small brain) is located at the back of the brain and controls body movement and posture. HiPSCs were used to derived cerebellar-like organoids that contain the cerebellum specific cells. The organoids cells were allowed for attaching to a coated surface before staining for different neuronal markers. This image shows that the cells not only had neuronal axon (green) but also were positive for glutamate (red). Glutamate is one of the neurotransmitters that is responsible for over 90% of neuronal communication within the brain. These brain organoids will allow us to model human neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.,,,08,qatar_item,artinSTEM,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/obj09/full/250,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/images/obj09/full/full/0/default.jpg,/img/derivatives/iiif/obj09/manifest.json

obj17,Viewing Cancer Through a Mathematical Lens,Kelsey Gasior,2016,Microscope,Postdoctoral Researcher,Mathematics,Biomathematics,"This image captures MCF7 (breast) carcinoma cells and was taken while researching the epithelial mesenchymal transition. The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which epithelial cells change the way they behave so as to adopt the mobile and invasive properties of mesenchymal cells. By undergoing EMT, cancer cells are able to metastasize. Several factors can inhibit the upregulation of EMT, such as cell-cell adhesion. Cell-cell adhesion can promote the presence of E-cadherin (a transmembrane protein), which is shown in red. The nuclei of the cells are shown in blue. A classic marker of mesenchymal cells, vimentin, was tagged with a green fluorescent marker. In this image, cells are completely confluent and have grown on top of each other. Cells exhibiting vimentin and undergoing EMT are actually below the top layer of cells. Thus, despite the abundance of cell-cell contact, some cells are still capable of transitioning and becoming invasive. 
 
 As a biomathematician, I tend to see biological problems through a mathematical lens: using mathematics to understand the world around me feels like putting on a pair of glasses.
