obj28,Brain Organoid in a Test Tube,Timothy Hua,2019,Microscope,Graduate Student,Chemistry and Biochemistry,Stem cell technologies and Cancer research,"Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can differentiate into any cell type within the human body. They have been used to generate various organoid models that mimic interest organs, such as the brain for development and disease models. The cerebellum (small brain) is located at the back of the brain and controls body movement and posture. An atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a lethal pediatric brain cancer that mainly originates from the cerebellum. Children under age three have an aggressive phenotype of ATRT with a low overall survival rate. Currently, there is no systematic and no effective treatment for ATRT, and therefore, a cancerous model is necessary for improving the understanding of the cancer mechanism and treatment. 

HiPSCs were used to derived cerebellar-like organoids that contain the cerebellar-specific cells. The organoid cells were allowed to attach to a coated surface before staining for different neuronal markers. This image shows that the cells showed neuronal axons (green) and were positive for glutamate (red). Glutamate is one of the neurotransmitters responsible for over 90 percent of neuronal communication within the brain. Our organoid model can generate the ATRT cancerous model, hence improving the understanding and therapeutic evaluation for ATRT. Also, our model can be used to create other disease models such as medulloblastoma (another cancer type that mainly originates from the cerebellum) and ataxia (a degenerative neuronal disease that occurs in the cerebellum).",,,01,qatar_item,art2021,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/obj28/full/250,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/images/obj28/full/full/0/default.jpg,/img/derivatives/iiif/obj28/manifest.json

obj38,Filtered Fluorescence,Alex Robb,2020,DSLR,Graduate Student,Chemistry and Biochemistry,Photochemistry,"Photon upconversion is the process of converting low-energy photons into higher energy ones. This has proven to be useful in a wide variety of applications, but especially for solar energy conversion in which most of the low energy photons from the sun can not be absorbed effectively, thus leading to low solar energy conversion efficiencies. If that low-energy light could be absorbed, then it would greatly increase the efficiency of different solar energy conversion schemes. Therefore, in order to study this process, our group has been synthesizing molecules capable of performing upconversion, and this photo is an insight into the synthesis of one such molecule.",,,11,qatar_item,art2021,"/img/derivatives/iiif/images/obj38/full/250,/0/default.jpg",/img/derivatives/iiif/images/obj38/full/full/0/default.jpg,/img/derivatives/iiif/obj38/manifest.json

Epiphytes are organisms, especially other plants, microbes, fungi, or lichens, that grow on the surface of plants. These epiphytes often benefit their host plant by retaining water and attracting pollinators. There are three species of epiphytes in this photo. The small ferns are Resurrection Ferns (Pleopeltis polypodiales). The filamentous grey-green structures are Spanish Moss (Tillandsia usneoides), a relative of pineapple. Lastly, the wavy pale-green structures are a type of lichen. Lichens are composed of two or more species including a fungus and an algae. 

My research explores plant microbiomes, which are composed of a diverse collection of epiphytic microbes.

Here, samples are being taken for dissolved organic matter analysis. You can see a darkening of the ice in the photo, potentially from atmospheric dust deposition, including black carbon from fossil fuel emissions, as well as microbial processes and rock/soil matter. All of these sources may contribute organic matter to glacier environments. The Ecuadorian water samples, from over 18 glaciers in the region, were brought back to FSU and analysed at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory via ultrahigh resolution mass-spectrometry. This technique allows us to untangle the chemical complexity of the dissolved organic matter. This research will aid the understanding of the sources of and reactivity of dissolved organic matter in glacier environments, ultimately helping us to elucidate how ongoing glacier retreat may impact carbon dynamics in downstream aquatic ecosystems.
