Description: Solar energy harvesting has evolved into a premier technology for realizing
  a sustainable energy future. Work in our research lab focuses on studying solar
  cells sensitized by dyes that absorb light and convert it into electricity on a
  semiconductor interface. My research focused on synthesizing the thermally activated
  delayed fluorescence dye, incorporating it into the bilayer solar cells, which is
  important to the solar cellsâ€™ efficiency in converting solar energy into electricity.
  This is the TADF sensitizer solid I made and because of its special absorption feature,
  it has this artistic mars looking color.
