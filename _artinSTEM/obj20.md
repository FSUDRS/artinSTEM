Description: "The image '24' was inspired by the death of a Star - Kobe Bryant. It
  was done to remind us to live because life is a sequence of 0s and 1s; it can be
  at '1' today and '0' tomorrow. I created this art by applying image processing technique.\n
  \n Image processing is significant in the automatic interpretation of biological
  and space images, the recognition of face and characters (e.g. plate numbers), to
  mention a few."
