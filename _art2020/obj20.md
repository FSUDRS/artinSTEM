description: "The image &#x0027;24&#x0027; was inspired by the death of a Star - Kobe
  Bryant. It was done to remind us to live because life is a sequence of 0s and 1s;
  it can be at &#x0027;1&#x0027; today and &#x0027;0&#x0027; tomorrow. I created this
  art by applying image processing technique.\n \n Image processing is significant
  in the automatic interpretation of biological and space images, the recognition
  of face and characters (e.g. plate numbers), to mention a few."
