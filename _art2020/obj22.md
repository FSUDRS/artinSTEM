description: We grow maize plants in a variety of genetic backgrounds in order to
  study gene regulatory mechanisms. Here we see brace roots aiding in the plant&#x0027;s
  stability as it grows. By studying how maize genes are regulated we can further
  understand maize development and aid agricultural endeavors.
