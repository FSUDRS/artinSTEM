description: Tiny pieces of DNA code in specific locations can produce massive effects
  on an organism. We see in this photograph the power of that code - causing the intense
  production of a pigment protein which makes these maize kernels appear dark purple.
  This is the result of a random event that inserted ~1000 bases of "junk DNA" nearby
  a gene, which changed the normal program leading to a new observable trait. Using
  molecular biology and genetics, we can harness this diversity to understand how
  and why these apparently random events happen and to develop new traits in agriculture.
