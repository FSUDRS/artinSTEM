description: Bronfenbrennerâ€™s ecological systems theory and symmetrical archaeology
  are underlying principles and theoretical framework that looks at the arrangements
  of symmetrical relationships of human behaviors such as past and present, people
  and place, individuals and society, biology and culture in various systems. It is
  a way to view how humans are intrinsically interconnected to everything in our world.
  In this case, the relationship of my study is how humans are "drivers" or "actors"
  in complexities of nature, specifically in ecosystems. The symmetrical relationship
  between humans and plants, directly and indirectly, shape our environment and our
  culture. In this example, photographed is a purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea)
  at this angle, in part, to demonstrate two observable phenomena. One is to show
  the symmetry found in nature as it is artistically photographed here and the other
  is the symmetrical relationship between humans and plants. E. purpurea was and is
  widely used by the Plains Indians and Choctaw Native Americans for a painkiller,
  cough treatment, and gastro-intestinal aid and later used as an immune-stimulant
  in modern medicine. This symmetrical relationship established that the human need
  for medicinal treatment which slowly turns into a symbiotic relationship making
  a connection between humans and plants. The connection then alters the environment
  indirectly to support both species. Then finally, the cultural aspect of humanity
  is imbued to the object, in this case, the purple coneflower creating the bio-cultural
  symmetrical relationship.
