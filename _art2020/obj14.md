description: What is in the photo? A red eyeball! It is actually a by-product after
  a column. Save "useless" product sometimes. Maybe it will be a miracle in the future,
  like becoming an eyeball! In Hanson research group, we will design and synthesis
  light absorbing and emitting molecules. Making molecules with different structures
  can change the electrochemical and photophysical properties. Follow us to see more
  cool molecules.
