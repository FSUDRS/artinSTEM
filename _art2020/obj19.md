description: "This art piece originated from atomic force microscopy (AFM) showing
  the morphology of the composite optoelectronic materials, where the \"mountains\"
  correspond to the matrix material Cs4PbBr; while the \"rivers and hills\" represent
  the emitters CSPbBr3, who is held in the matrix material to fulfill extraordinary
  light-emitting performance. The light emitting diode (LED) based on this material
  features 200 times higher brightness than a typical computer monitor.\n \n The author
  paid tribute to one of the greatest works of ancient Chinese painting \"a panorama
  of rivers and mountains\"."
