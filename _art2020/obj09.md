description: Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (HiPSCs) can differentiate into
  any cell types within the human body. They have been used to generate various organoid
  models that mimic the organs of interest such as the brain for development studying
  and disease modeling. The cerebellum (small brain) is located at the back of the
  brain and controls body movement and posture. HiPSCs were used to derived cerebellar-like
  organoids that contain the cerebellum specific cells. The organoids cells were allowed
  for attaching to a coated surface before staining for different neuronal markers.
  This image shows that the cells not only had neuronal axon (green) but also were
  positive for glutamate (red). Glutamate is one of the neurotransmitters that is
  responsible for over 90% of neuronal communication within the brain. These brain
  organoids will allow us to model human neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.
