description: Chemistry is cool... quite literally in this image! Here, you see a cryogenic
  cuvette with a fluorescent sample placed inside. With the help of this cuvette and
  a cryostat, we are able to monitor complex light-matter phenomenon at temperatures
  as low as 77 K. Using temperature dependent measurements, the Hanson Group is able
  to better understand kinetics that largely impact the effectiveness of dye-sensitized
  solar cells, and thus work to improve them.
