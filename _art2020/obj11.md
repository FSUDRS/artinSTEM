description: 'This image is part of a healing process after a Thyroidectomy. This
  procedure was done after being diagnosed with Thyroid cancer. The complete removal
  of this butterfly-shaped organ was the beginning of a metamorphosis in consciousness,
  physical adaptation and healing. This image reflects a dual and metaphorical metamorphosis:
  the butterfly-shaped organ that leaves its chrysalis and the healing process of
  my body while learning to let go. Living without a Thyroid has been without a doubt
  a metamorphosis of new daily routines, body processes and new perspective on self-love.'
