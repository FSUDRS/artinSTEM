description: My work broadly focuses on the effects of human activities on coral reef
  ecosystems. More specifically I am interested in how nutrient enrichment from mismanaged
  waste water and fertilizers affects the sponges that inhabit the coral reef. These
  grey angelfish (Pomacanthus arcuatus) perused the reef around me as I assessed sponge
  populations in Belize. I make note of their numbers as these peaceful wanderers
  will graze on the sponges that I am tracking.
