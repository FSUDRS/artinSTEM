description: Several compounds I attempted to synthesize that did not turn out as
  expected were used in this art piece to create a flower. The green and purple compounds
  are Chromium containing compounds (dehydrated and hydrated). The compound in the
  middle is metallic, a synthesis fail from manganese and tellurium containing oxides.
  The flowers were made to represent that we can learn from mistakes in science and
  create something new or something beautiful. Never give up, and keep making mistakes
  and learning from them. It is all about perspective and careful analysis. The compounds
  intended were synthesized successfully after careful reevaluation of the synthesis.
