description: The picture shows well defined crystals of 4,4&#x0027;-((1E,1&#x0027;E)-(4,6-dimethyl-1,3-phenylene)bis(ethene-2,1-diyl))bis(methylbenzene)
  under 310nm light. these crystals direct light through its center towards its edges
  like fiber optics. this structure will be used to form a substituted pyrene containing
  its substitutions in positions that are very scarce of examples. this material is
  one of many examples being synthesized for the development of a new method of assembling
  substituted pyrene cores.
