description: The bubbles form when aluminum was deposited on a thin flake of topological
  insulators (TI) BiSbTeSe by thermal evaporation. TI is a kind of material which
  is conducting on the surface but insulating in interior. Aluminum is a common metal
  in daily life but actually superconducts at low temperature (-270 degC). The study
  of the interface between aluminum and TI helps develop the understanding of some
  fundamental questions in condensed matter physics and more well-known field quantum
  computing. Obtaining flat and clean interface between aluminum and TI is critical
  in experiments. We found that the bubbles only form with liquid nitrogen cooling
  (-100 degC) during the evaporation, which destroys the sample but has its own beauty
  as art in science.
