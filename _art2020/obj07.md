description: Pictured is a reversible stimuli-responsive molecular switch. Application
  of an external stimuli (UV/visible light or an applied potential) can be used to
  switch between two different, thermodynamically stable forms. Molecular switches
  such as this one show great potential for applications in logic gates, photochromics,
  and sensing.
