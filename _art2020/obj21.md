description: The polymer was synthesized, dissolved in water and deposited on a silicon
  wafer. The result was an interesting pattern on the surface. This strong positively
  charged polymer can be used to form thin films. These multilayers have a wide range
  of applications ranging from electronics to biosensors and tissue engineering.
