description: This macro shot of the mouth of a pencil urchin Sterocidaris nascaensis
  that was collected from 300 meters deep as part of an ecological survey in the South
  Pacific Ocean on the Salas y Gomez Ridge. Urchins eat algae and bacterial mats by
  scraping organic material off of rocks, pebbles, or even sand grains, which sounds
  like velcro when recorded underwater.
