description: Solar energy harvesting has evolved into a premier technology for realizing
  a sustainable energy future. Work in our research lab focuses on studying solar
  cells sensitized by dyes that absorb light and convert it into electricity on a
  semiconductor interface. My research focused on synthesizing the thermally activated
  delayed fluorescence dye, incorporating it into the bilayer solar cells, which is
  important to the solar cells’ efficiency in converting solar energy into electricity.
  This is the TADF sensitizer solid I made and because of its special absorption feature,
  it has this artistic mars looking color.
