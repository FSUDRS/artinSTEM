description: Bioinformatics assists in solving biological problems with the help of
  algorithms, statistical analysis and coding. This art piece indicates that we can
  study the DNA, RNA, or protein structures through the eyes of computer science or
  coding. It is a field where biology and computer science are merged. My research
  is focused on finding mutations that can lead to cancer on single cell DNA and RNA
  with the help of statistical analysis. With these statistical analyses and coding,
  we can predict or detect mutations which might be otherwise difficult to diagnose.
  I created this art piece by merging pictures from National Cancer Institute, 10X
  Genomics Visium and Unsplash.
