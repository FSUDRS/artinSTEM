description: "A novel organic-inorganic hybrid semiconductor material developed in
  our laboratory was processed into a solution and crystals were grown from this solution
  by drop-casting on a hot plate at 153° Celsius. These types of hybrid crystals are
  now being studied and applied towards cheaper, more efficient, and environmentally-friendly
  optoelectronic applications such as X-ray imaging detectors, LEDs, solar cells,
  etc. \n\nOf particular significance to my research is their application in X-ray
  imaging towards safer health care, scientific/industrial research, and national
  security."
