  Left: Sulfite reductase flavoprotein, eight subunits (blue), N-terminal helical bundle (pink). Flavoprotein envelope is generated using small angel neutron scattering data (light blue). Middle: Sulfite reductase hemoprotein, four subunits (green). Hemoprotein envelope is generated using small angel neutron scattering data (light green). Right: Sulfite reductase (grey) superimposed with sulfite reductase flavoprotein (blue) and sulfite reductase hemoprotein (green).


  Sulfite reductase (SiR) is a flexible oxidoreductase that performs six-electron reduction by converting sulfite to bioavailable sulfide. SiR is a dodecamer, composed of eight copies of flavoprotein and four copies of hemoprotein. We have used small angle neutron scattering (SANS) technique to understand the higher order assembly of this dodecamer. SANS allowed us to model eight copies of flavoprotein for the first time. Structural studies will help us to understand the structure-function relationship of SiR.
