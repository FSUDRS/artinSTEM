description: NS2B3 is a pair of molecular scissors used by dengue virus to cleave human
  protein cGAS so that it can survive and establish infection in the host cell. Here,
  we have determined the molecular structure of the active site mutant of NS2B3 (on
  the right). On the left-hand side, we have the picture of NS2B3 mutant protein crystals
  on which X-ray diffraction data was collected.
