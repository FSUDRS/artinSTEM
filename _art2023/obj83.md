description: These are tiny solidified hydrogen particles used to make the flow of
  superfluid helium visible. When liquid helium is cooled below a critical temperature
  of around -450.20Â° Fahrenheit (2.17 Kelvin), it becomes a superfluid with zero viscosity.
  In regular fluids, tracer particles are carried along by viscous forces to visualize
  flows, but this method does not work in superfluid helium due to zero viscosity.
  Instead, the particles become trapped by vortices (i.e., tiny whirlpools), allowing
  researchers to observe the "invisible" flow. The original video was created September
  2022. This picture was clipped March 2023.
