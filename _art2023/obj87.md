description: Dibenzotetraphenylperiflanthene (DBP) red dye solution and green CdSe
  nanocrystals in vials that look like Christmas lights when viewed under ultraviolet
  light. The CdSe nanocrystals are the focus of my research on luminescent materials,
  and this photo was taken to show the public how beautiful and colorful chemistry
  research can be. The DBP dye chosen is one of many dyes we use in our lab that can
  be mixed with other materials (like nanocrystals) to study the energy transfer between
  the materials.
