description: This piece of art shows the accumulation of plastic particles within
  human cells. The potential health hazards of plastics in humans are largely unknown;
  however, they can certainly degrade into micro and nano sizes and enter the human
  body. This image was captured using a phase-contrast microscope and shows microplastics
  that are 1 Âµm in size having entered human neuron-like cells and surrounding the
  nucleus. This image speaks out loud that if we do not control our plastic consumption,
  the day is not far when humans will become "plastic humans."
