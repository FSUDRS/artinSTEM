description: We are studying the effects of common substances that can impact human
  cardiovascular health. In this picture, we are showing a cardiomyocyte that has
  been exposed to nicotine, an active compound found in cigarette smoke. We used fluorescence
  imaging to capture the cardiomyocyte that was loaded with Fura-2 a calcium indicator
  dye. Sometimes I can see these single cells still beating under the microscope!
