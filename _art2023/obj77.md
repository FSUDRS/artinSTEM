description: We study cardiomyopathies, diseases that affect the cardiac muscle, using
  mice models to study the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic
  cardiomyopathy at the molecular, cellular and organ level. This picture was taken
  during a cardiomyocyte isolation experiment where we cannulate the aorta and perfuse
  the heart with an enzyme solution to ultimately obtain single cardiomyocyte cells.
  We can then measure calcium transients and contractility.
