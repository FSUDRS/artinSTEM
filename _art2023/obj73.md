description: This is the crude mixture of a reaction I ran on relatively simple molecules
  to create precedence for doing the reaction on more complex and valuable molecules
  for reaction development. After getting the information I needed from the crude
  mixture, I accidentally left it in the back of my fume hood for about a month, and
  then looked into the round bottom flask it was in to find these crystalline projections
  had formed in a pattern that somewhat resembles the laurel leaves often found on
  medals. While the reaction itself certainly isnâ€™t Nobel-worthy, I still take it
  as a good omen for things to come.
