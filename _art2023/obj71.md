description: The growing edge of an inorganic precipitate membrane composed entirely
  of nickel and magnesium hydroxides. Such mineral surfaces exist within the walls
  of deep-sea hydrothermal vents and on the rocky surfaces of extraterrestrial worlds.
  These chemical gardens have captivated us since the days of the alchemists, and
  for good reason, as they just may hold the keys to the origins of life itself.
