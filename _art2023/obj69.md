description: This art was done in a 2D Heleshaw cell. The picture is sodium silicate
  and cobalt chloride reaction that creates a precipitate. The patterns and colors
  of this reaction are determined by concentration, the flow rate and solvents. The
  growth of precipitates can help with the understanding of many biological systems.
