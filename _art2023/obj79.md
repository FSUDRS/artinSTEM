description: Over the course of two years, I tried to make one set of molecules but
  was never successful. These are the surviving vials of my failed attempts because
  I finally cleaned them out of my drawer. Sometimes the best thing you can do for
  research is to step back, take a fresh look at the problem, and change direction.
