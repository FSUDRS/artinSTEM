description: This art piece shows the very intriguing phenomenon of communication
  between immune cells, also known as hemocytes or blood cells, being attracted to
  colorectal cancer cells. The tumor cells have green fluorescent protein, which gives
  them a deep green color, while the blue is because of DAPI, which stains the nucleus
  of cells. The immune cells moving toward the tumor are marked by red antibody stain.
