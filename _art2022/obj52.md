description: "Our lab mainly focuses on the organization and maintenance of chromatin
  on the inactive X chromosome (Xi). We use gRNA mediated gene deletion, exploiting
  CRISPR/Cas9 system to delete specific gene of interest from primary cell line. In
  this image, a technique called FISH (fluorescence in-situ hybridization) is used
  to verify that the ATRX gene, located on X chromosome, has been deleted from active
  X-chromosome in RPE1 cell line. \nATRX-specific probe(green) can only be seen in
  one X-chromosome. Chromosomes are stained in DAPI and red probe is showing the ZFX
  gene, a X-specific gene, used to locate X-chromosome. This research aims to understand
  the role of ATRX gene in X-chromosome chromatin dynamics."
