description: 'Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) are differentiated into
  cardiomyocytes and cultured in our lab to study diseases of the heart muscle. Our
  study aims to aid discovery of new and better therapeutic treatments for patients
  with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. The image shows an immunocytochemistry
  of mature human cardiomyocytes. Each color reveals a feature of these cells: DNA
  in blue, F-Actin in red, TNNT2 in magenta, and MLC2V in green.'
