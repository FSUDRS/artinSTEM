description: "This is an exercise in data visualization. It is important to be able
  to visualize data, to get important insights that may not be apparent when we look
  at just numbers. \n \nThis visualization uses Machine Learning to predict flight
  delays in departure and arrival and, if possible, utilizing Artificial Intelligence
  to automate the flight scheduling process of COPA Airlines (which at present is
  done manually) to increase efficiency, reduce delays, and improve customer experience.\n\nData
  of some random flights of Copa Airlines is visualized as a network, where nodes
  represent the flights, and links or connections between the nodes represent passenger
  transfers between flights at PTY airport at Panama City. (PTY airport is the hub
  of COPA Airlines, so almost all flights of COPA Airlines have PTY airport as either
  origin or destination.)\n \nNodes (representing flights): All the nodes are in a
  circular arrangement. Each node is labeled with 6 letters of the flight’s origin-destination
  code. The first 3 letters denote the flight’s origin airport, and the last 3 letters
  denote the flight’s destination airport.\n\n*\tThe node color is red for inbound
  flights (arriving at PTY airport), and green for outbound flights (departing from
  PTY airport). \n\n*\tThe node size is directly proportional to the flight distance
  (that is, distance between origin and destination airports). \n\n*\tLinks between
  nodes (representing passenger transfers at PTY airport, from inbound flights to
  outbound flights): \n*\tThe link color is directly proportional to the number of
  passengers transferring (varying from light for few passengers, to dark for many
  passengers).\n*\tThickness is constant for all links."
