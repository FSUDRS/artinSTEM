description: Phylogenetic trees are fundamental for understanding the evolutionary
  history of a set of species. Understanding the local neighborhoods of a phylogenetic
  tree is essential, but since trees are high-dimensional objects, discussing these
  neighborhoods is difficult. We developed the Python package Pathtrees that uses
  the geodesic distance between pairs of trees and their likelihoods to build a continuous
  tree landscape. The art piece shows an example of trees along the shortest path
  (geodesic) between three arbitrary trees (colored triangles) in the tree space.
  We used the cubic spline interpolation and the multidimensional scaling  to display
  both the contour (left) and the surface (right) of the space of 1,000 trees and
  20 pathtrees (red dots). We use this tool to find the best tree and describe its
  neighborhood.
