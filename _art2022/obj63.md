description: This is a 1,4,5-tryaryl triazole which is rotated to show that the aryl
  groups are twisted. This molecule can have two different hydrogen bonding conformations.
  The conformers fluoresce at different wavelengths and therefore have excitation
  dependent emission. This may be useful in creating white OLEDs. The structure shown
  is a non-hydrogen bonding conformation.
