description: This work demonstrates a way of treating nuclear waste used in power
  plants and factories is to bind chemicals to radioactive elements, making them easier
  to remove from toxic solutions. Shown here is a simulation of such a reaction, where
  Thorium (a radioactive element) is bound to three cyclopentadiene anions. Here I
  visualize an orbit of one of the electrons that help bind these molecules together,
  giving deeper insights into the underlying quantum mechanics. I used ray-tracing
  (a rendering technique used in modern video games) to give a more ‘life-like’ image
  of this bond.
