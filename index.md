Art has proven to be an excellent medium for the expression of STEM research, and the annual “Art in STEM” exhibition aims to provide a creative outlet for the Florida State community to explore the beauty and artistry of science. 

This exhibition helps bridge the gap between scientific discovery and popular interest by making sophisticated science accessible to a wider audience. Explore the digital exhibition here and be sure to visit the physical installation inside FSU’s Dirac Science Library.
