The annual “Art in STEM” exhibition aims to provide a creative outlet for the Florida State community to explore the beauty and artistry of science. This exhibition helps bridge the gap between scientific discovery and popular interest by making sophisticated science accessible to a wider audience. 

Art has proven to be an excellent medium for the expression of STEM research. Until 2020, “Art in STEM” took place exclusively as an installation in FSU’s Dirac Science Library. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the exhibition moved online in 2020 and this year remains in a virtual format so members of the FSU and global community can enjoy and be inspired by the outstanding work of these scientist-artists.
