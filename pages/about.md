The annual “Art in STEM” exhibition provides a creative outlet for the Florida State community to explore the beauty and artistry of science. This exhibition helps bridge the gap between scientific discovery and popular interest by making sophisticated science accessible to a wider audience.

Pieces in this year’s collection were created and captured using various scientific and photographic techniques and span disciplines including computer science, physical chemistry, materials chemistry, biochemistry, optoelectronics, structural biology, cell and molecular biology, computational biology and bioinformatics, biomedical sciences, virology, nutrition and integrative physiology, low-temperature physics, and nuclear astrophysics.

“Art in STEM” is a collaboration among the FSU Graduate Women in STEM, the FSU Office of Digital Research and Scholarship, FSU Libraries, and the FSU College of Arts and Sciences.
