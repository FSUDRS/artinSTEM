The annual “Art in STEM” exhibition provides a creative outlet for the Florida State community to explore the beauty and artistry of science. This exhibition helps bridge the gap between scientific discovery and popular interest by making sophisticated science accessible to a wider audience.

Art has proven to be an excellent medium for the expression of STEM research. Pieces in this year’s collection were created and captured using various scientific and photographic techniques and span disciplines including chemistry and biochemistry, physics, biological science, mathematics, biomedical sciences, and scientific computing.

“Art in STEM” is a collaboration among the FSU Graduate Women in STEM, the FSU Office of Digital Research and Scholarship, and the FSU College of Arts and Sciences.
