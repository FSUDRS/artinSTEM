The annual “Art in STEM” exhibition aims to provide a creative outlet for the Florida State community to explore the beauty and artistry of science. This exhibition helps bridge the gap between scientific discovery and popular interest by making sophisticated science accessible to a wider audience. 

Art has proven to be an excellent medium for the expression of STEM research. For the last five years, “Art in STEM” has taken place in the Dirac Science Library and year moves to a virtual exhibition to ensure the outstanding work of these scientist-artists may still be enjoyed by and inspire members of the FSU and global community during the pandemic.
