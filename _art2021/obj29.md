description: This work depicts the photoluminescence of zinc oxide nanocrystals. Different
  emission colors can be achieved through multiple structural manipulations of these
  nanocrystals. In this work, green is chromium (III) doped zinc oxide, yellow is
  quantum confined zinc oxide, and red is europium (III) doped zinc aluminum oxide.
  The ability to manipulate the color of a phosphor is useful for the design of white
  light LEDs for lighting applications.
