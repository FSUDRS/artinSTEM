description: |-
  This picture was captured from the Antisana volcano, on the surface of Antisana 12 glacier (~ 4751 m above sea level), Ecuador in February 2020, as part of the Vanishing Glacier Projects’s (NOMIS foundation) global field campaign. Here, samples are being taken for dissolved organic matter analysis. You can see a darkening of the ice in the photo, potentially from atmospheric dust deposition, including black carbon from fossil fuel emissions, as well as microbial processes and rock/soil matter. All of these sources may contribute organic matter to glacier environments. The Ecuadorian water samples, from over 18 glaciers in the region, were brought back to FSU and analysed at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory via ultrahigh resolution mass-spectrometry. This technique allows us to untangle the chemical complexity of the dissolved organic matter. This research will aid the understanding of the sources of and reactivity of dissolved organic matter in glacier environments, ultimately helping us to elucidate how ongoing glacier retreat may impact carbon dynamics in downstream aquatic ecosystems.
