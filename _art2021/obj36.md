description: A molecular dye (left, red) and plasmonic nanorods (right, blue) come
  together to illustrate the different ways colors arise. The dye relies on the excitation
  of electrons from pi to pi* orbitals, while the nanorods exhibit their unique color
  due to the coupling of incoming light with free electrons in the nanomaterial.
