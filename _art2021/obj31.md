description: Pictured is a cuvette containing zirconium oxide (ZrO2) suspended in
  acetonitrile. In the Hanson lab, nanocrystalline ZrO2 is used as a substrate for
  the construction of surface-bound molecular assemblies. The unique properties of
  ZrO2 allow us to investigate the surface chemistry of these assemblies using spectroscopic
  methods.
