description: Each vial in the image contains differently sized quantum dots (QDs),
  which are fluorescent under ultraviolet excitation. The redder QDs are larger, causing
  their band gap to be smaller, and emit lower energy light (red vs. yellow). QDs
  can be used in displays, or in our case, used to help upconvert low energy light
  to high energy light.
