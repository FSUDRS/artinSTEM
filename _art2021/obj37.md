description: A redox-sensitive biosensor was virally delivered to an islet of Langerhans
  and selectively expressed in β-cells. Islets of Langerhans are endocrine cell clusters
  found in the pancreas, primarily made up of insulin producing β-cells. These cells
  are responsible for maintaining blood glucose levels in the body. This research
  works to understand the cellular stress beta cells experience while stimulated by
  measuring reactive oxygen species in β-cells.
