description: This image depicts human HEK293 cells, which express the SARS-CoV-2 protein
  ORF7A and which have been tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). This tag
  allows us to visualize where the protein is in a given cell and allows us to assess
  which cells produce the protein. DAPI was used to stain nuclei blue to contrast
  the green viral protein. These cells were part of an experiment designed to understand
  how SARS-CoV-2 impacts epigenetic regulation.
