description: The image shows the crystal growth of an organic salt, the product of
  a failed synthesis. The goal was to co-crystallize the organic salt with metal halides
  and study their photophysical properties. However, I ended up with these yellow
  emissive flower-like crystals of the organic salt alone. I guess, even failed synthetic
  reactions can be beautiful!
