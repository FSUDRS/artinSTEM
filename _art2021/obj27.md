description: The radula is a feeding structure unique to molluscs and, in sacoglossan
  sea slugs, it’s reduced to a single-pointed tooth per row that is used to puncture
  algal cells. I used this scanning electron microscopic image along with others from
  from 20 different specimens to perform integrative species delimitation of a taxonomically
  challenging clade of sacoglossan sea slugs, the E. tomentosa complex, that can be
  ecologically important in controlling invasive algal species of Caulerpa.
