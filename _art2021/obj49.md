description: This is a single crystal of Na2Mn2Se3 compound that is synthesized at
  high temperatures in a carbon crucible. All preparations must be done in an inert
  atmosphere. This Image was captured by the Rigaku Synergy Single Crystal Diffractometer.
  This research is important to understanding broken magnetic frustration ocurring
  in the comparison of single crystal and powdered samples.
