description: Photon upconversion is the process of converting low-energy photons into
  higher energy ones. This has proven to be useful in a wide variety of applications,
  but especially for solar energy conversion in which most of the low energy photons
  from the sun can not be absorbed effectively, thus leading to low solar energy conversion
  efficiencies. If that low-energy light could be absorbed, then it would greatly
  increase the efficiency of different solar energy conversion schemes. Therefore,
  in order to study this process, our group has been synthesizing molecules capable
  of performing upconversion, and this photo is an insight into the synthesis of one
  such molecule.
